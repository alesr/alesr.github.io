### Nuvem K (Portugal)

My first role in the programming world. “Hello, World!” I guess.
It introduced me to a wide range of development areas. I built institutional websites, created e-commerce platforms, implemented apps for motion tracking devices, and developed CLI tools using Go. It was also where I was introduced to the Scrumban methodology (the right way).

I’ll always be thankful to Luis Palolo and Marcio Machado for hiring me during my first year at university, for the flat hierarchy, for supporting my learning path, for trusting me, and for including me in every aspect of the decision-making process.

**Tech Stack**: PHP, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, CSS, HTML, Go.

### 3fs (Slovenia)

After two years working as a junior full-stack developer at Nuvem K, I gained a clear understanding of what I wanted to focus on. The year was 2016, and Docker, Go, and microservices were coming in hot—I was eager to work with them!

At 3FS, I had the privilege of working with an extremely talented and competent team of developers: Fred, Andras, David, Samo, and Nikolas. Once again, I felt incredibly lucky! I learned a lot about the technical side of the work and was truly inspired by how efficiently everyone operated.

During my time at 3FS, I worked on implementing a cloud service provider in collaboration with Ericsson.

**Tech Stack**: Go, Docker, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, and Angular.

### Marionete (Portugal)

For personal reasons, I had to return to Portugal. At that time, I was still interested in development but wanted to learn more about DevOps and infrastructure. I joined Marionete as a DevOps engineer, where I had the opportunity to work with Ansible, Docker, and Terraform, and on consolidating my foundations in Linux.

I primarily focused on providing development, staging, and production environments, as well as implementing CI/CD pipelines for other teams. But had the also the chance on contributing on design and implementing Ways of Working and mentoring on testing strategies and best practices.

**Tech Stack**: Go, Docker, Terraform, Ansibile, Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Logstash, RabbitMq, and Kafka.

### Betalo / PFC (Sweden)

In 2017, I decided to move from Portugal to Sweden and move my focus now to Backend Developement.

Once again, I joined another incredible team that was in charge of maintainig an application for online payments that was written in PHP that was then being migrated to Go. Later on, we developed and released the first swedish neo bank!

It was an extremelly rewarding experience, which allowed me to learn so much about System Design and Software Architecture. As a small team, we had complete ownership and shared responsability on the entire process.

**Tech Stack**: Go, PHP, PostgreSQL, Docker, Heroku, AWS.

### VOI (Sweden)

I joined VOI together with two friends from PFC. At that time in Sweden, electric scooters were booming, and VOI was one of the most exciting companies to work for—not only because of the technical challenges and the innovative industry it was operating in, but also for its ecological appeal.

Within the company’s first six months, I became part of a team responsible for building microservices that managed fleet and market operations, field activities, repairs, and parts inventory, which involved three different frontends. I also worked on systems for license plate renewals, the design and implementation of e-bike start/end ride functionality, and scooter battery replacement workflows.

At VOI, I acted as a Senior Backend Developer and gradually became involved in mentoring and team leading. Although, I must say, the best teams to work on are those where highly competent and sensible people share responsibilities on a project. Fortunately, that was also the case at VOI.

This was the time where I also experienced the not so good side of the IT industry and the consequence of years negleting work-life balance and had a burn out. *Been there, done that, and took a lot to heal*. Valueable learnings for a leader in IT.

**Tech Stack**: Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, PubSub, Redis.

### Telia (Sweden / Remote)

Telia was my first gig as a contractor working fully remote. I joined a team responsible for maintaining and developing Conversational AI services. Initially, I worked as a Backend Engineer, but I was soon offered the role of Product Owner. This was my first experience as a Product Owner, but I felt comfortable in the role since I’ve always been interested in software development as a means to enable sustainable and efficient product growth.

**Tech Stack**: Go, PostgreSQL, GCP, Kubernetes.

### Bitpanda (Romania / Remote)

After my experience as a Product Owner, I decided to return to the developer path and started working once again as a Senior Backend Engineer. At Bitpanda, I was responsible for reimplementing and revamping one of the trade services, migrating it from PHP to Go.

This role provided a great opportunity to lead the implementation and support my colleagues in learning Go.

**Tech Stack**: Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Kafka.
