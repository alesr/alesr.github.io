1. It's Dave Cheney. 

The talk distills practical advice that tends to stay true no matter the hype cycle: keep software understandable, favor clarity over cleverness, and optimize for long-term maintenance.

It is especially useful when mentoring or reviewing PRs because it gives language for why certain Go practices make teams faster over time.
