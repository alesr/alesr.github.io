Old talk video, but so relevant today. With more AI-generated code, there's more demand for dev tools that support engineers in accessing static and dynamic analysis data.

I'm also interested in how SSA representations can affect how AI reasons about the code. Maybe something for [Lacune](https://github.com/alesr/lacune) using [mcpgen](https://github.com/alesr/mcpgen) =]
