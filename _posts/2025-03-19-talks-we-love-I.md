I have plenty of ideas for things I want to write about—[some already in progress](https://github.com/alesr/chachacha)—but time is always a bit short. The main point, though, was never to be too rigid or only post super-polished material. There’s far more value in sharing and exchanging ideas than in waiting to publish something that will always feel imperfect anyway. And honestly, allowing myself to lower the bar a bit makes everything a lot more fun!

With that in mind, I’m starting a series to share some of the talks I love—both new ones and old favorites that I keep coming back to. Hopefully, they’ll help you grow as well.

And to kick things off… If there are two things I’d love to borrow from Rob Pike, it’s his confidence to wear certain outfits and his incredible ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms.

Without further ado: **Rob Pike on Software Engineering**
